Let's switch to a different approach by using a combination of `sed` and `printf` to ensure the escape sequences are correctly handled.

Here’s an updated version of the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

RESET="\e[0m"
bar="▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█"
# ANSI color codes for different shades of red (256-color mode)
red_colors=(
    "\e[38;5;160m" "\e[38;5;161m" "\e[38;5;162m" "\e[38;5;163m"
    "\e[38;5;164m" "\e[38;5;165m" "\e[38;5;166m" "\e[38;5;167m"
)

# write cava config
config_file="/tmp/polybar_cava_config"
echo "
[general]
bars = 40

[output]
method = raw
raw_target = /dev/stdout
data_format = ascii
ascii_max_range = 7
" > $config_file

# read stdout from cava
cava -p $config_file | while read -r line; do
  for ((i=0; i<${#line}; i++)); do
    char="${line:$i:1}"
    printf "%b%s%b" "${red_colors[$char]}" "${bar:$char:1}" "$RESET"
  done
  printf "\n"
done
```

### Explanation:

1. **ANSI Color Codes Array**: The `red_colors` array contains the escape codes for different shades of red.
2. **Cava Configuration**: The configuration file is created as before.
3. **Processing Output**: 
   - For each line of output from `cava`, the script iterates through each character.
   - It uses `printf` to print the corresponding colored bar character.
   - The `%b` format specifier in `printf` ensures that escape sequences are interpreted correctly.

This should ensure that the colored bars are displayed properly.
